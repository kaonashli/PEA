**RATIONAL FOR COLOUR PALETTE** 
Colour Palette: #ffbb00, #00273f, #0090e3, black, white
I chose these colours because they are professional and remind me of school.

**RATIONAL FOR THE BANNER DESIGN**
For the large breakpoint I wanted a design that was nice and large for the screen but you can also see some of the content when you open the page. As you scroll down the banner disappears leaving the navigation.

For the medium breakpoint, I also wanted something that was also nice and large and would take up most of the screen. The navigation is smaller and stays at the top right side for easy access.

For the small breakpoint, I wanted a smaller banner that would follow as you scroll with less information because it would be on mobile. I removed some of the information in the banner that is found in the footer because they are both visible on the same small screen. 

**CSS3 FEATURES**
The flashing text cursor in the header uses animation to make it appear like a text cursor. 

**TOOLS USED**
Bootstrap
jQuery
Figma (to create the logo)
