            <h4>Agile Methodology</h4>

            <p>
                For our development project we used the Agile methodology. This methodology uses short cycles of work
                called sprints that allows for constant implementation and testing in the development process. This
                process focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation and involves customer
                collaboration. This allows the process to be more flexible and adaptable to changes making it an
                extremely effective and productive methodology.
                In the planning and analysis phase, the product backlog is created from user stories. <br> A User Story is a
                description of one of the features of a system. It is used to define functional requirements. It is
                often written from the perspective of an end user or a user of a system. They are accompanied by
                Acceptance Criteria which defines the conditions that need to be met to complete the User Story.
                Once the product backlog is complete, there is a sprint planning where the development team and the
                product owner create the sprint backlog. Our sprints lasted 2 weeks and during this time the team
                develops and continuously tests the product backlog items. Every day during the sprint, there is a daily
                scrum which is a 15-minute meeting in which the scrum master asks 3 questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What have you done yesterday? </li>
                <li>What will you do today? </li>
                <li>Did you run into any issues? </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                At the end of the sprint, once the sprint backlog items are complete and have been tested and reviewed,
                there is a sprint review and sprint retrospective. In the sprint review, the status of the sprint items
                is reviewed, the working product is demonstrated to the product owner and the team gets feedback. Sprint
                retrospective is where the team reflects on the sprint, process and lessons learned. We ask ourselves 3
                questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What worked well? </li>
                <li>What didnâ€™t work well? </li>
                <li>What could be improved? </li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Analysis</h5>
            <p>
                I think this was the most appropriate methodology to use for developing our project.
                For a project in which the requirements are not completely clear, it gave us more control and visibility
                by facilitating
                quick implementation of changes as well as allowing the team to focus on small parts of the project at a
                time.
                The only drawback I experienced were, due to the lack of experience in coding and estimating, we
                underestimated many user
                stories which resulted in higher expectations, and a demand for more functionality from the product
                owner. This, I find,
                made our project go slightly off track, as we are focusing on aspects that are not concentrated on
                completing a working product.
