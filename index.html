            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                My name is Ashley Boily and this is my online portfolio.<br>
                I am a student at Heritage College in the Computer Science program. In our final year of the program, we are required to complete
                a Program Exit Assessment (PEA). The purpose of the PEA is to demonstrate achievement of the objectives and 
                standards determined for the Computer Science Program through preparing a digital portfolio based on 
                the project completed in the Development Project courses. 
                This web site serves this purpose. The navigation bar can be used to access different sections of the PEA.<br>
                You can also refer to <a target="_blank" href="documents/Ashley_CV.pdf">my resume</a> which provides 
                additional information on my overall work experience.

            <h4>PEA Project</h4>
            <h5>Learning Centre System</h5>
            <p>
                The Brigil Learning Centre (BLC) has been providing tutoring services to students in various subjects. 
                Due to COVID19 and social distancing,
                teachers at the BLC had been meeting with students online through Discord.
                Although Discord is a great tool, it had some limitations. The BLC needed a system that could allow students to queue up for online or in-person meetings.
                Additionally they also needed a way to automatically log information about those meetings.<br>
                Our solution was to create the Learning Center System (LCS).
                Our system improved the overall experience of users by replacing the physical log book, 
                reducing overall paperwork that professors must track,
                and by allowing students to queue up anytime during the professor's tutoring session.
                This system was developed by Ashley Boily, Ibrahim Ahmed, 
                Jeremy Barbeau-Gagnon, Gabriel Jolicoeur-McCharles, Maxim Lam and Tyler Lehmann with Richard Chan as our project manager during the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 semesters.
                The team worked together in 2 week sprints using Team Foundation Server for version control, to store documents and to manage our tasks.

            <h4>Applied Experience</h4>
            <p>
                At the end of our first and second year, students have the opportunity to work 2 co-op work terms. This gives us the chance to gain experience before graduating. 
                For each work term, students are required to have an average of 70% in all their CS courses as well as write a co-op report at the end of the work term.
            </p>
            <h5>DND Co-op 2019</h5>
            
            <p>
                During the summer of 2019, I worked for Department of National Defense (DND) for DIMEUS. As a technical support officer, 
                my main tasks involved handling service requests (tickets) for clients when they had any kind of 
                computer related issues or tasks. For more information on this work term you can refer to my 
                <a target="_blank" href="documents/report_2019.pdf">DND Co-op Report</a>.
            </p>
            <h5>ESDC Co-op 2020</h5>
            <p>
                During the summer of 2020, I worked for Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). 
                As a developer, my main task was to create some report pages and to provide graphing functionality to the reports. 
                For more information on this work term you can refer to my 
                <a target="_blank" href="documents/report_2020.pdf">ESDC Co-op Report</a>.
